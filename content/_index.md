        My research agenda revolves around two interconnected questions: how do external great powers shape European integration, and how do domestic politics mediate states' foreign and security policy choices?

        I address these questions through a combination of qualitative Bayesian reasoning, process tracing, and comparative case analysis. I am currently supported by an **SNSF Ambizione Grant Fellowship** for the project *Great Power Competition and European Integration*.

        **Current projects include:**
        - How crisis windows produce reversible delegation in EU foreign policy (R&R at JEPP)
        - Triangulated capture: how geopolitical competition reshapes EU enlargement conditionality (R&R at EJPR)
        - Domestic determinants of military aid disclosure in France and Germany (under review)
        - A Cambridge Element on the EU's response to the Russo-Ukrainian War (with Invernizzi, Nasr & Schimmelfennig)

        I comment regularly on European security, Romanian foreign policy, and EU politics. Recent appearances include the *Washington Post*, *Politico Europe*, *Le Monde*, *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung*, *Al Jazeera*, and *AFP*.

        I also write the Substack newsletter [**Priors & Posteriors**](https://priorsandposteriors.substack.com/), focused on rigorous analysis of European politics and security.
