## Great Power Competition and European Integration

*SNSF Ambizione Grant Fellowship*

How do the United States, China, and Russia shape European integration? My core research project develops a theoretical framework distinguishing four strategies that external great powers use to influence the EU: **binding** (creating structural dependencies), **compellence** (coercion under time pressure), **wedging** (exploiting internal divisions), and **subversion** (undermining legitimacy). The framework traces how these strategies interact with domestic political cleavages across member states to produce integration, fragmentation, or stasis in different policy domains.

**Key outputs:**

- *Crisis Windows and Reversible Empowerment in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy* (R&R at JEPP)
- *Triangulated Capture: EU Conditionality, Geopolitical Competition, and the Logic of State Capture* (R&R at EJPR)
- *Crisis and Integration: How the Russo-Ukrainian War Redefined the EU's Boundaries* (Cambridge Element, with Invernizzi, Nasr & Schimmelfennig)
- *From Transformation to Demarcation: Explaining the EU's Shifting Motivations of the Enlargement Policy* (JEPP 2025, with Pleșca)

## Domestic Politics of Foreign and Security Policy

Why do democratic governments sometimes pursue foreign policy in secrecy, and how do they construct domestic consensus for international commitments? This strand of my research investigates variation in transparency about military aid, the role of electoral incentives in shaping disclosure strategies, and the conditions under which legislatures defer to executives on security policy.

**Key outputs:**

- *Shrouded in Secrecy: Explaining Why Some Countries Refuse to Disclose Their Military Aid to Ukraine* (Foreign Policy Analysis, 2025)
- *Domestic Politics and Military Aid to Ukraine: Explaining Disclosure Policies in France and Germany* (under review, with Minatti)
- *Forging Consensus: The Domestic Politics of Foreign and Security Policy* (book manuscript in preparation)

## Methods

I specialize in qualitative and mixed methods research, with particular focus on **qualitative Bayesian reasoning** and **process tracing**. These approaches enable systematic evaluation of competing causal explanations and transparent assessment of evidence strength in small-N research designs.

At ETH Zurich, I teach graduate courses on research design and qualitative methods. I am developing pedagogical materials that make Bayesian process tracing accessible to graduate students without requiring formal statistical training.
