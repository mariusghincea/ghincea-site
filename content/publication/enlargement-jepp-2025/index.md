abstract: "This article examines the evolving motivations underlying the European Union's enlargement policy, particularly following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. While existing scholarship rests on competing assumptions regarding the EU's motivation, these accounts assume unchanging EU motivations. We argue that the EU's enlargement policy has been driven by distinct and shifting 'policy logics': transformation, stabilization, demarcation, and cohabitation. Drawing on content analysis of European Council conclusions from 1990 to 2024 and comparative case studies, we show that the hierarchy among these logics has changed over time."
