abstract: "This research note examines the communication strategies employed by Central and Eastern European countries in disclosing or withholding information about their military aid to Ukraine following the Russian invasion. Using a comparative case study design, this research note analyzes the contrasting approaches of Romania and Poland. The findings reveal that electoral incentives drove both Romania's secrecy and Poland's transparency."
