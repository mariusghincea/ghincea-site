abstract: "We develop a dual-path framework to explain how moral mobilization and capacity-building efforts interact in shaping the EU's functional boundaries. Through a detailed case study of the EU's response to the Russo-Ukrainian War, our process tracing challenges the assumption that crises can exclusively be either failure- or attack-driven."
