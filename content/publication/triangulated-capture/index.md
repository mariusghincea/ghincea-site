abstract: "This article introduces a triangulated capture model, which embeds the stabilitocracy mechanisms within a multiple-principals bargaining framework. Incumbent elites hedge between EU rewards and rival-patron rents, thereby lowering the costs of non-compliance and prompting EU institutions to practice strategic forbearance. Employing Bayesian process tracing in a crucial case study, the article demonstrates how geopolitical competition reshapes both domestic incentives and EU leverage."
