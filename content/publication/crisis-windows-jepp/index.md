abstract: "This paper conceptualizes the pattern of rapid EU coordination followed by re-fragmentation as reversible delegation within CFSP. Drawing on the competence-control framework, it argues that external shocks temporarily raise the marginal value of EU-level competence, prompting member states to relax control constraints. Once immediate pressure subsides, authority reverts to intergovernmental control."
