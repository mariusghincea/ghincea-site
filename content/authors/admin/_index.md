Marius Ghincea is a postdoctoral researcher and university lecturer at ETH Zurich's Department of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, supported by an SNSF Ambizione Grant Fellowship. He is also a Visiting Fellow at the European University Institute's Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies.

His research examines how great power competition shapes European integration. He develops a theoretical framework distinguishing four strategies that the United States, China, and Russia use to influence the EU: binding, compellence, wedging, and subversion. A related strand of his work investigates the domestic politics of foreign and security policy, including how governments construct consensus for international commitments and why states vary in transparency about military aid.

He specializes in qualitative and mixed methods, with particular focus on qualitative Bayesian reasoning and process tracing. His publications appear in the *Journal of European Public Policy* and *Foreign Policy Analysis*, with work under review at the *European Journal of Political Research*. He is preparing three book manuscripts for Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press.

In Romania, he serves on the Advisory Board of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and co-founded the Quartet Institute. He comments on European affairs in outlets including the *Washington Post*, *Politico Europe*, *Le Monde*, and *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung*.
