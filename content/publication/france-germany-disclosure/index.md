abstract: "Why have France and Germany adopted divergent and shifting policies on disclosing their military aid to Ukraine? We argue that domestic politics, not international signaling or political culture, best explains this puzzle. We theorize that leaders use transparency as a legitimation tool to manage audience costs when their policy preferences diverge from a hawkish public. Using a most-similar comparison employing qualitative Bayesian reasoning, we find strong support for our argument."
